1.	What id devops?
Devops = development + operations
Developers= who write code
Operations = who deploy / manage system

2.	Example: Image you are building a mobile app like swiggy 
The developer writes code to add “track my order “ feature 
without Deveops: developer gives code to ops team-> they manually develop-> bugs happen delay
with Devops: Code is automatically testd and deployed-> customers get updates faster and safely
DevOps Helps you :
        Release feature faster( like adding new payment methods in zomato)
        Fix bugs ( like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
        Automate repetative task( like server restart, dataset backup)

3.	Plan : Define what to build
Develop : Write the code
Build : Compile code into deployable formate
Test :Check for bugs automatically
Release  : Approve the build for deployment
Deploy : push app to server or app store
Operate : keep app running, fix any issues
Monitor : analyze performance and feedback

4.	GIT = version control system (local)
GITHUB : ONLINE platform to store git projects
